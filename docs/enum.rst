Enum
=====================

Use iterable that length greater than 1 to define enum type.

Use ``graphene.Enum`` for enum that only has one possible value if you really need.

Enum definition can be a string or 2-value tuple.
when using tuple, first tuple item used as enum value, second tuple item used as description.
